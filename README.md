## Game rules

- The player can be moved only by using the 4 arrow keys (Up, Right, Down, Left).
- Each press of an arrow key moves the player one block in its direction i.e. Right moves a player to the right, Left to the left, and so on.
- The task is to guide the player into water by avoiding contact with the insects.
- Every successful completion of the task is recorded and the number of successes is displayed at the top right corner.
- Every insect bite reduces task count by 1.
- Successfully completing the task 5 times earns an Orange gem.
- Earning 3 Orange gems gives a Golden Star.
- The games ends once a Golden Star is obtained.
